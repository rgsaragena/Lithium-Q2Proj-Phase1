                As airports in the U.S. break records 
                this holiday season with millions of 
                travelers, Miami is leading the 
                nation in delays, according to 
                FlightAware. A surge in passengers, 
                severe weather and short staffing in 
                air traffic control are all 
                contributing to the disruptions.
                NBC News' Sam Brock has the latest.

                WASHINGTON - If you were 
                among the tens of millions of
                Americans who traveled 
                over the  
                holiday season last year and are planning 
                Americans who traveled over the  
                holiday season last year and are planning
                on doing the same in 2023, you may notice a 
                lot more congestion on the nation's highways
                and at the airports.

                That's because the American 
                Automobile Association (AAA) estimates 115.2 
                million people will travel more than 50 miles 
                from home over the 10-day, year-end holiday 
                travel season this year - an increase of 2.2% over 2022.
                This year-end holiday forecast, with an additional
                this year - an increase of 2.2% over 2022.This 
                year-end holiday forecast, with an additional 
                2.5 million travelers compared to last year, mirrors
                what AAA Travel has been observing throughout 2023,'
                said Paula Twidale, Senior Vice President of AAA Travel. 
                "More Americans are investing in travel, despite the cost,
                to make memories with loved ones and experience new places."

                AAA says the number of people who are instead traveling 
                by other means, like taking a bus, a train or a cruise, 
                is projected to be higher than the number reported in 2019.
