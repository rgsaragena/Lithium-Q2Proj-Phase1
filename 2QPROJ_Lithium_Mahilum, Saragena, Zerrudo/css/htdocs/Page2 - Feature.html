            In this article, the author, Eric Weiner tells you why travel for human beings is irreplaceable.
            Thanks to him we learn that, travel except for amusing tourists holds an important role in the 
            process of getting to know our world, building empathy and helping us feel united as a species. 
            Yet through his travels, Eric Weiner proves to us that he does not regard travelling as a luxury 
            or crutch at all. He sees travelling as an experience, an experience that everyone should get to
            have at least once.

            The article talks about the insight that travel has given us into different cultures and peoples. 
            And in this article as we look gradually across continents and cultures through Weiner's eyes, he
             writes about numerous different aspects (interesting folk and places), experiencing in turn many
              different lifestyles. Describing the extraordinary experiences of people whose lives have been 
              completely transformed by their journeys, the article presents an interesting account of travel 
              as sowing self-knowledge and harmony among countries.

            As the world continues to recover from the damage of COVID-19, this article by Eric Weiner is a clear 
            reminder that the ability to travel plays an essential and vital role in human life. However, this 
            story makes us rethink what travel should be in our lives and above all explains how traveling around
             the world in fact influences humanity positively as a whole.
