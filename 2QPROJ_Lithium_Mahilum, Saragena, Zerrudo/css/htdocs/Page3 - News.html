            The deadly plane collision took place at 5:46 p.m. local time (3:46 a.m. ET) on Tuesday. Five people were killed when
            a JAL jet, carrying hundreds of passengers from the northern city of Sapporo, collided with an earthquake relief aircraft
            and burst into flames on landing at Haneda.All 379 people on JAL flight 516, including eight children under the age of 
            two, were safely evacuated from the passenger plane, according to the airline.Five crew members died on the second aircraft,
            a De Havilland Canada DHC-8, according to Japan's transport minister, Tetsuo Saito.Video showed a huge fireball erupt as 
            the JAL plane ignited, leaving a fiery trail down the runway.Investigations into the crash are now underway, with experts 
            telling CNN the successful evacuation is down to a combination of modern safety standards and JAL's own rigorous safety culture.
